# GMEXT-Bluetooth
Repository for GameMaker's Bluetooth Extension

This repository was created with the intent of presenting users with the latest version available of the extension (even previous to marketplace updates) and also provide a way for the community to contribute with bug fixes and feature implementation.

This extension will work on Windows (10 and later, needs winrt), macOS, iOS and Android.
